# QuantumMiner
Advanced multi-cryptocurrency mining software with dashboard with an efficiency boost system.

### Core Architecture

## Mining Engine
The software should utilize a modular mining engine that supports multiple algorithms. Like CudoMiner, it should feature intelligent algorithm switching to automatically mine the most profitable cryptocurrency. The engine needs to support both CPU and GPU mining with optimized resource allocation - GPUs can be tens or hundreds of times faster than CPUs for parallel processing tasks like mining.

## Hardware Management
Implement dynamic hardware detection and optimization similar to MultiMiner's automatic hardware detection capabilities. The system should automatically identify available CPUs and GPUs, then allocate workloads based on each component's capabilities while maintaining thermal and power limits.

### Performance Optimization Features
## Auto-Tuning System
Following CudoMiner's approach, implement advanced auto-tuning that provides preset optimizations per hashing algorithm. The software should automatically adjust overclocking settings, memory configurations, and power limits to maximize hashrate while protecting hardware longevity.

### Intelligent Resource Management

**Power Limiting: Allow users to set power consumption limits for GPUs to balance performance with electricity costs**
**Thermal Protection: Implement automatic throttling when temperatures exceed safe thresholds, similar to FluxEdge's color-coded temperature monitoring system**
**Background Operation: Use CPU/GPU usage throttling to ensure the system remains responsive for other tasks**

### Dashboard and Monitoring
## Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
Design a comprehensive interface for the Miner's dashboard that displays:

Current hashrate for each mining device
Total network hashrate and mining difficulty
Real-time earnings and profitability calculations
Power consumption and efficiency metrics
Temperature monitoring with heat map visualization
Uptime statistics and historical performance data
Mining Statistics Display

Blocks Found: Track successful block discoveries and rewards
Pool Statistics: Display accepted/rejected shares and pool performance
Payout Tracking: Monitor pending and completed payments to wallet6
Historical Data: Provide exportable CSV data for long-term analysis

Wallet Integration
Direct Payout System

**Implement seamless wallet integration where all mining rewards flow directly to user-specified addresses, similar to zpool's automatic payout system.**

##Support multiple wallet formats including:
Standard cryptocurrency addresses (BTC, ETH, etc.)
Hardware wallet integration for enhanced security
Multi-currency wallet support for different mined coins

# Security Features
Following EasyMiner's security approach, implement "military-grade security" with encrypted connections and secure wallet management. Include multi-factor authentication and secure API integrations for wallet operations.

# Efficiency Settings and Optimization
Algorithm Selection

Automatic Switching: Like CudoMiner's intelligent switching, automatically select the most profitable coin based on real-time market conditions.
Manual Override: Allow experienced users to manually select specific algorithms or coins.
Pool Integration: Support multiple mining pools with automatic failover capabilities.

# Power and Performance Tuning
Based on mining efficiency best practices:
Undervolting/Underclocking: Reduce power consumption without significantly impacting performance

# Memory Optimization: Automatically tune GPU memory settings for optimal hashrate
Fan Control: Intelligent cooling management to maintain optimal temperatures

### User Experience Design

Multi-Algorithm Support

**Support popular mining algorithms including SHA-256 (Bitcoin), Ethash, KawPow, and others, with the ability to add new algorithms through updates.**

## Network Integration
Implement robust pool connectivity with SSL/TLS encryption and multiple backup pools to ensure consistent mining operations.

## Resource Efficiency
Design the software to be lightweight like EasyMiner, with minimal CPU overhead and optimized memory usage. Implement intelligent scheduling to run mining operations during system idle periods.

## Revenue and Profitability Features
Profit Calculation

Real-Time Estimation: Calculate daily income based on current hashrate, difficulty, and market prices.
Historical Tracking: Maintain records of actual vs. estimated earnings.
Cost Analysis: Factor in electricity costs for accurate profit calculations.

## Market Integration
Include live cryptocurrency price feeds and difficulty adjustments to maintain accurate profitability estimates, similar to the rotating banner features found in existing mining software.

This design framework provides a comprehensive foundation for developing efficient mining software that balances performance, usability and security while ensuring sustainable mining operations.
